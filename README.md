## ======Together We Fight Breast Cancer=====

# Understanding:
Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.

After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.

Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease.
Early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of surviver. The key challenges against it's detection is how to classify tumors into malignant(Cancer) or benign(not cancer). A tumor is considered malignant (Cancer) if the cells can grow into surrounding tissues or spread to distant areas of the body. A benign tumor does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body the way cancer can. But benign tumors can be serious if they press on vital structures such as blood vessel or nerves.

### Why Machine Learning for classification?
* Machine Learning technique can dramatically improve the level of diagnosis in breast cancer. Research shows that experience physicians can detect cancer by 79% accuracy, while 91%(up to 97%) accuracy can be achieved using Machine Learning techniques.

## Project Task:
In this project, our study is concerned with the tumors as are malignant (i.e., Cancerous) and benign (i.e., Non Cancerous) using features obtained from several cell images.
